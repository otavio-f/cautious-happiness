# jsFF - FFMPEG on JavaScript

![ffmpeg logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/FFmpeg_Latest_logo.svg)

This is a "quick and dirty" interface for accessing ffmpeg binaries.
It can quickly create and execute a command line, parse input and output and set up options and filters.

## TODOs:

- [x] Fluent Command Builder;
- [x] Input/output/error monitoring;
- [x] Stream as input/output;
- [x] Basic events;
- [ ] Fine-tuned events;
- [ ] Abort on Error;

**The FFMPEG binary must be placed on the current dir.**
